# TO DO

- improve back/forward views which are currently semi-broken (probably need to 
  build a custom matplotlib nav toolbar)
- add ability to save a coords array to a gpx file
- add track statistics
- ability to select portion of a track (initially for the statistics)
- add split track tool
- add elevation (two choices: read from gpx or get from a DEM)
- add different y-axis choices for the graph
- add different x-axis choices too (initially distance instead of time but also
  later distances from arbitrary points)
